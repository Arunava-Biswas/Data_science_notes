    "- **What are `Outliers`?**\n",
    "    - This is the data point that behaves differently than the other data points in that distribution.\n",
    "    - It is the **`Black Sheep`**.\n",

    "- Although `Outliers` are dangerous but sometimes they should be kept as a part of the data like in case of **`Anomaly Detection Algorithms`** i.e. finding credit card frauds.\n",
    "- This can create bad impact for some ML algorithms like: `linear regression`, `logistic regression`, `AdaBoost`, `Deep Learning models`. The common factor in all these models is that we need to calculate **weights** in all these algorithms. So if we need to work on **weight based algorithms** then outlier will definitely impact the outcome of that model.\n",
    "- But algorithms which are **Tree** based like: `Decision Tree`, `Random Forest`, `Gradient Boosting`, `XG Boost` here the *`outliers`* don't impact the outcome that much.\n",

    "- **How to treat `Outliers`?**\n",
    "    - **Trimming:**\n",
    "        - This is completely removing the outliers from the dataset.\n",
    "        - It is a very fast approach.\n",
    "        - It may make the dataset very thin (less in numbers) if there are too many *`Outliers`*.\n",
    "    - **Capping:**\n",
    "        - Most of the times the *`Outliers`* are mainly found at the both ends of the distribution.\n",
    "        - Here we put a limit by using **`(IQR)`** beyond which range everything is an *`Outlier`*.\n",
    "    - We can also treat *`Outliers`* as *`missing values`* through **`Imputation`**.\n",
    "    - We can also apply **`Discretization`** on *`Outliers`*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How to detect `Outliers`?**\n",
    "    - If the column has a perfect or close to a *`Normal`* distribution, then if any data point is out of the range of **$\\mu$ + 3 $\\sigma$** or **$\\mu$ - 3 $\\sigma$** then it should be treated as *`Outlier`*.\n",
    "    - If the column has a *`skewed`* distribution, then we can use **`IQR`** with the help of *`Boxplot`* to detect and remove *`Outliers`*.\n",
    "    - We can also apply **Percentile** based approach to create the range outside which we treat every data points as *`Outliers`*."
