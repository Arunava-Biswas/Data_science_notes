    "**How to increase the revenue of Netflix?**\n",
    "- Possible ways are:\n",
    "    - Increase number of customers (Difficult to implement straight forward)\n",
    "    - Increase subscription charges of present customers (Not a correct way)\n",
    "    - Stopping the existing customers who are leaving the platform (This is the best way)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transforming to mathematical problem**\n",
    "- So suggestion is to decrease the **Churn Rate**. The **Churn Rate** is calculated as in a given period of time how many users out of the total users are leaving the platform. Suppose **Netflix** has a **Churn Rate** of `4%`.\n",
    "- As our final goal is to increase revenue so we need to cut down the **Churn Rate** to `3.75%` within next 6 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem type**\n",
    "- Here we need to see the **Big Picture** i.e. the **End Product**.\n",
    "- As our goal is to reduce the **Churn Rate**, so our main task is **`Identify the users who are about to leave?`**\n",
    "- Here the **End Product** is to create a solution so we can stop the migration of users. Easy way is offer a Discount on next month's subscription, so we can get some time to find out the real cause of the customer leaving the platform.\n",
    "- So it seems to be a ***`Classification Problem`*** where we have to make predictions whether a customer is going to stay or leave the platform.\n",
    "- But giving uniform discount to all customers is a very financially bad decision.\n",
    "- So we can differentiate between customers leaving the platform on the basis of probability. That is we can generate a probability score for each customer whether he/she wants to leave or not. Greater the score means more probability that user will leave the platform, and we can offer him higher discount to stop him from leaving. So we can offer discount on the basis of this score.\n",
    "- Now it becomes a ***`Regression Problem`***.\n",

    "- How many searches by the customer did not provide a result for the customer in a given month, that is percentage of successful search for content by each customer.\n",
    "- Also need to find out how many times the customer leave a show in the middle in a given month. It says that the content is not that much interesting to the customer.\n",
    "- Need to see how many recommendations actually used by the customer provided by the UI.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning**\n",
    "- We need to find how to train our model.\n",
    "- Here we may use Online learning as it is very difficult to find out the time spent by users on the platform.\n",
    "- So best way is the model continuously gets trained from the data from the data warehouse which is coming from the OLTP(Main server of the Netflix).\n",
