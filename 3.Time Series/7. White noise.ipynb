    "### White Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "- White Noise has following 3 characteristics:\n",
    "  - **Constant Mean**\n",
    "  - **Constant Variance**\n",
    "  - **No AutoCorrelation**: The values of the time series at a particular period has no relation with the values of the past time period.\n",
    "- So there is no pattern in the `White Noise` data.\n",
    "- **Whenever we find a `time series` data is `White Noise` we need to abandon the project, as it is impossible to forecast future values for that series**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Checking `White Noise` using visual inspection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/wn1.png\" width="600">\n",
    "\n",
    "- Here it is a `White Noise` as the `mean` is constantly around `0`, and the variations are of similar kind.\n",
    "- However there is no `Auto-correlations` that can be visually identified.\n",
    "- So we cannot say that if we know the particular value at a particular time period we can estimate the next value, as there is no pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/wn2.png\" width="600">\n",
    "\n",
    "- It doesnot have a `Constant Mean`, so we can directly disqualify it.\n",
    "- However there is a clear `Auto-correlation` as we can see the repeating peaks.\n",
    "- So in this case we can make a prediction for the future if we know the particular value at a peak, we can successfully predict that in the next time period there will also be a rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/wn3.png\" width="600">\n",
    "\n",
    "- It does have some `Constant Mean` but there is clear `Auto-correlation`.\n",
    "- So in this case if we know the particular value at a particular time stamp we may can estimate what the values are going to be in the next time period, as there are some patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **So to identify the `White Noise` we need to use the following methods:**\n",
    "  - Visual Inspection\n",
    "  - Global and Local checks\n",
    "  - Auto Correlation plots\n",
    "  - Statistical Tests"
