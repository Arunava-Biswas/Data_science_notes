    "\n",
    "**Classes:**\n",
    "- A class is a collection of objects. \n",
    "- A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. \n",
    "- It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods.\n",
    "- Classes are created by keyword **`class`**.\n",
    "- Attributes are the variables that belong to class.\n",
    "- Attributes are always public and can be accessed using dot (.) operator. Eg.: \n",
    "> `Myclass.Myattribute`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objects:**\n",
    "- An Object is an instance of a Class. A class is like a blueprint while an instance is a copy of the class with actual values.\n",
    "- The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects.\n",
    "- When an object of a class is created, the class is said to be instantiated. All the instances share the attributes and the behavior of the class. But the values of those attributes, i.e. the state are unique for each object. A single class may have any number of instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An object consists of :\n",
    "  - **State:** It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.\n",
    "  - **Behavior:** It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.\n",
    "  - **Identity:** It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "**self:**\n",
    "- Class methods must have an extra first parameter in the method definition. We do not give a value for this parameter when we call the method, Python provides it.\n",
    "- If we have a method that takes no arguments, then we still have to have one argument.\n",
    "- The **self** represents the instance of the class. By using the `self`  we can access the attributes and methods of the class in python. It binds the attributes with the given arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Characteristics of `self`:\n",
    "  - Self is always pointing to Current Object.\n",
    "  - Self is the first argument to be passed in Constructor and Instance Method.\n",
    "  - Self is a convention and not a Python keyword.\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "**__init__():**\n",
    "- The Default `__init__` Constructor is used to initializing the object’s state. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is created. Like methods, a constructor also contains a collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at the time of Object creation. It runs as soon as an object of a class is instantiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class and instance attributes:**\n",
    "- Instance variables are for data, unique to each instance and class variables are for attributes and methods shared by all instances of the class. Instance variables are variables whose value is assigned inside a constructor or method with self whereas class variables are variables whose value is assigned in the class."

    "### `Inheritance`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inheritance** is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that derives properties is called the `derived` class or `child` class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the `base` class or `parent` class.\n",
    "- It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "- It provides the re-usability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "- Python provides a function `issubclass()` that directly tells us if a class is subclass of another class.\n",
    "- `isinstance()` returns whether an object is an instance of a class or of a subclass thereof.\n",
    "- We can access the parent members in a subclass either by using the parent class name or by using the `super()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Single Inheritance:***\n",
    "  - Single-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single-parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Multilevel Inheritance:***\n",
    "  - Multi-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from an immediate parent class which in turn inherits properties from his parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Hierarchical Inheritance:***\n",
    "  - Hierarchical level inheritance enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Multiple Inheritance:***\n",
    "- Multiple level inheritance enables one derived class to inherit properties from more than one base class. During multiple inheritance the derived class will give priority to class and attributes of the first mentioned class in the bracket if there is a conflict of attribute or method name between the parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ***Hybrid inheritance:***\n",
    "  - This form combines more than one form of inheritance. Basically, it is a blend of more than one type of inheritance."

It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. ***This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data***.\n",
    "- Remember if we have a private variable inside a class then with the help of the object of that class we will not be able to reassign any value to that variable. To do that we will need to create another method separately in that class (**setter method:** to set a new value). Then by calling that method of that class it is possible to change the value of that private variable.\n",

    "### `Multiple Constructors`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is it allowed to write multiple constructors`(__init__)` in a class in Python?\n",
    "- When writing program in other languages like (Java, .net, etc.)  we can create multiple constructors in the same class to initialize different parameters in it. But in python the last constructor we make will override the previous constructors. So in normal circumstances we cannot create multiple constructors in python for a same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To initialize multiple constructor we need to initialize the constructor with `*args`. The `*args` is the positional argument. - We can also initialize multiple constructors in a class using a keyword argument i.e. `**kwargs`. \n",
    "- Now by creating `if else` condition we can create multiple objects of different size constructors. But it is not a good practice.\n"
