    "### `Variable and Memory References / Mutability / Garbage Collection`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variable and Memory References:**\n",
    "- Variables are stored in Memory locations (RAM). The Memory locations are represented in Hexadecimal values.\n",
    "- The address provided is the sarting point of the address where the variable is stored in RAM.\n",
    "- The Python language stores the variable as \"name\".\n",
    "- Here when we print the variable name it will point to the location of the variable where the value is stored.\n",
    "- This pointing towards the value is named \"Call By Object Reference\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aliasing:**\n",
    "- When we create a variable and create an alias of that variable the address of both the variable and it's alias will be same.\n",
    "- So both the variable and it's alias will point to the same location.\n",
    "- Even if we delete the variable the alias will still be there and keep pointing towards the value.\n",
    "- Here actually the value doesnot get deleted, it is the reference towards that value which actually gets deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reference Counting:**\n",
    "- To know how many variable are pointing towards one memory location.\n",
    "- To know this we use in built function \"getrefcount()\" from \"sys\" module.\n",
    "- When we run any Python program, it gets interpreted into the bytecode. The reference count of the object is calculated based on the number of times object is used in the bytecode (not from our high-level program code).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Garbage Collection:**\n",
    "- When we delete the variables pointing towards a  value stored in the memory, the value doesnot get deleted. As a result the memory stayed occupied even though no variable is using it, so it is a waste of memory (occupied but unused). This is not good. Now Python as a program doesnot allow the user to clear the memory manually unlike C program where we can use pointers.\n",
    "- In Python internally a program keeps running periodically known as \"Garbage Collector\". This program keeps running and checking if there is any memory which is occupied but unused. If it find any memory like that it will free that memory.\n",
    "- This process is known as \"Garbage Collection\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some interesting but Weired behaviors of Python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weired Behavior 1:**\n",
    "- When using getrefcount() we should get the result as \"number of variables pointing towards that location + 1\" but instead we get some other anonymous numbers. \n",
    "- It happened because it shown the total number of variables pointing towards that memory at that time.\n",
    "- The reason behind it is if we store a common value (e.g. 2) in that variable then in the system already many variables are using that value as it is a common value. That is why it gives an anonymous number as a result.\n",
    "- In actual case here when we created \"a = 2\" then 2 doest not get created in the memory as it is already present in there and \"a\" just start pointing to the location of the value 2 which is already there in the memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weired Behavior 2:**\n",
    "- If we store same values in 2 different variables the address of both the variables will be same.\n",
    "- But if we change the values in both the variables with same values sometimes the address will become different.\n",
    "- This happens because of Software Optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weired Behavior 3:**\n",
    "- When storing a string value which is a valid identifier (Doesnot start with a digit and has only \"_\" as special character in it) in variables then we will  get same address location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mutability:**\n",
    "- Mutability refers to the ability to change or edit data in it's memory location (memory address). \n",
    "- Mutability depends on the data type.\n",
    "- Immutable Data Types: String, Integer, Float, Bool, Complex, Tuple.\n",
    "- Mutable Data Types: List, Dictionary, Sets.\n",
    "- Remember whenever we apply any built in functions (append, insert, extend) on a mutable data type like \"list\" for editing then the memory address of the list after editing remains same. But if we do concatination with another list then the address gets changed as it will create a new list at a new memory location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cloning:**\n",
    "- Remember whenever working with a Mutable data type and we need to copy it then we should use Cloning. In this case the memory location of the copy is different from the original.\n",
